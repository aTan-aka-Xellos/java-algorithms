### Binary Cheat Sheet

Binary numeral system use only 1 and 0 to represent a number. Each digit is referred to as a single bit.  
Binary counting follow the same procedure as decimal, after digit reaches 1 in binary, 
an increment resets it to 0 and causes an increment of the next digit to the left:

#### Representing negative values  


#### Calculations
**Addition:**  
0 + 0 → 0  
0 + 1 → 1  
1 + 0 → 1  
1 + 1 → 1 0 (carry 1)  

**Subtraction:**  
0 − 0 → 0  
0 − 1 → 1 (borrow 1)  
1 − 0 → 1  
1 − 1 → 0  

**Multiplication:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        1 0 1 (A)  
&nbsp;                        × 0 1 1 (B)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        -------  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        1 0 1  
&nbsp;                  1 0 1  
                            0 0 0  
                            -----------  
                            0 1 1 1 1
